**🎵 Database Project: Spotify Simulation**

**📚 Overview**

  This project is part of the Database Foundations course, designed to help students apply their knowledge to build a complete database management system. The objective is to simulate a database system for Spotify, a globally popular online music streaming platform.
  
  Our team worked on this project to:
    
    -Analyze requirements and design a data model.
    
    -Implement and test a functional database system.
    
    -Gain hands-on experience in database design and optimization using MySQL.
    
🛠️ **Features**
  
  In this project, we focused on creating a database system that meets Spotify's core business requirements:
  
    **-User Management** 👤: Store and manage user profiles and preferences.
    
    **-Song Management** 🎶: Organize song metadata, artists, and albums.
    
    **-Playlist Management** 📂: Enable personalized playlists for users.
    
    **-Personalized Recommendations** 🤖: Simulate song recommendations based on user preferences.
    
🌍 **Why Spotify?**
  
  -Spotify is a leading music streaming platform with over 500 million monthly users worldwide.
  
  -It functions as a massive data system, handling billions of records related to songs, users, and artists.
  
  -Spotify’s success relies heavily on an efficient database system for storage, management, and analysis of music-related data.

🎯 **Goals of the Project**
  
  Through this project, we aimed to:
  
    -Understand the structure and functionality of large-scale database systems like Spotify.
    
    -Apply theoretical concepts of database modeling and SQL queries to a real-world scenario.
    
    -Learn best practices in database optimization for scalability and performance.

📋 **Key Deliverables**
  
  -Data Model 🗺️: A well-designed ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) to represent Spotify's database structure.
  
  -Database Implementation 🛠️: A fully functional MySQL database with tables and relationships.
  
  -SQL Queries 📄: Sample queries to demonstrate functionality, including:
  
  -User registration and profile updates.
  
  -Song and playlist management.
  
  -Generating personalized song recommendations.
  
  -Performance Optimization 🚀: Ensuring scalability and efficiency for handling large datasets.

🚀 **Technology Stack**
 
  -Database Management System: MySQL
  
  -Modeling Tool: ERD tools ( Draw.io)
  
  -Development Environment: SQL and command-line tools

📈 **What We Learned**
  -Designing scientific and structured databases for large-scale systems.
  -Using SQL for complex queries and real-world data operations.
  -Optimizing databases for performance and scalability.
  -Bridging the gap between theory and practice in database design.
